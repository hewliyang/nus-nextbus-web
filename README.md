> [!WARNING]  
> This project is no longer being maintained but should still work as long as the NUS bus API does not radically change. Additionally, the original [nextbus.me](https://nextbus.me) domain has expired so it's now only accessible via [bus.hewliyang.com](https://bus.hewliyang.com)

> [!NOTE]
> A minimal **PWA** for fetching and displaying NUS Internal Shuttle Bus routes & arrival timings because... too many NUS apps
